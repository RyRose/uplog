# TODO

This a list of ideas to improve this application.

## Improve UX of adding new events to schedule

Instead of only adding to end, we should consider support adding them inline and
then shifting the following events down. There's not a good UX that comes to
mind though.

## Improve UX of aggregates of core/push/pull

It's not pretty to just have an unordered list. Think about this.

## Next-level design

Problems with current version:

* Toilsome in auto-incrementing lifts for each cycle.
* No convenient way to input lifts.
* No convenient way to input routines

Things that should exist:

* Pages for inputting information.
* Pagek
